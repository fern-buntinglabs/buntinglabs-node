     * This is a list of tags in the form `key=value` to filter features for. All features extracted will satisfy each of the passed tags given by this parameter.
     * This tag list can be created by forming an array of `key=value` items and joining them into one string with the `&` character.
     * Because both = and & are reserved characters in URIs, this list must be URL encoded.
     * An example list of tags could be `leisure=park` and `name=Westglen Park`. This matches parks that have the name Westglen Park. To set this parameter, weâ€™ll URL encode leisure=park&name=Westglen Park.
     * Documentation on tags can be found on the [TagInfo](https://docs.buntinglabs.com/openstreetmap-api/count#:~:text=found%20on%20the-,TagInfo,-resource%20website) resource website.
